# Numpys the Easy Way ..

#### many of you people were trying to get into numpys may be due to lack of resources or due to lack of some support you may not be able to learn but actually you can do better .

##### I have Created the notes for begineers to get started with the numpys as they help a lot while dealing with various tasks that we  need while performing some simple calculations so just make sure you know python3 and just get straight into it .

 * i have created this as a basic guide ,if you want more please let me know in the issues section at github.com please  and if you want you can download an offline copy of notebook from the github code section. *

* link to live notebook <a href = "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TVw5CNk-_4Y16ZJUjEcfGbS2ZkSXCESb"> click here</a>

## Thanks in advance ..
